# Project goal
Practice building applications with OpenAI API, starting with a basic chatbot that can answer general knowledge questions.

# Tech stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenAI APIs

This is my first time using Streamlit. It is an open-source app framework and a Python package that can help me create a web application without involving any front-end framework or coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It serves my purpose well.

# MVP
- Get user input.
- Make requests to the Completion endpoint of OpenAI API to get responses to user input.
- Display the chat history on screen.

# Future improvements:
- Check contents of user input (by calling the Moderations endpoint).
- Evaluate inputs by classification.
- Check outputs and evaluation.
- Train the bot with specific datasets.
